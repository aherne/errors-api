# MVC Errors API

This is a revolutionary API created to elegantly and efficiently handle errors/exceptions in an application into log reports and server responses using a dialect of MVC paradigm. 

A STDERR micro-framework that feeds on errors (exceptions) instead of web requests, able to provide a powerful unified error handling strategy that works on MVC principles. Once an error has occurred in STDOUT flow (as a request is handled to produce a response), it gets automatically redirected (via standard PHP error redirection functions) to a dormant framework that wakes up when getting an error to handle.
